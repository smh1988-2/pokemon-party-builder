Search a database of Pokemon and create your own party.

- I want to search the database for a Pokemon.
- I want to to see that Pokemon and relevant information, including a picture.
- I want to be able to add that Pokemon to my party and display my entire party (up to 6 Pokemon).
- I want to see the stats, strengths, and weaknesses of every Pokemon in my party.

BONUS: I want to see the overall strengths and weaknesses for my team as a whole.
BONUS: I want to click a button to translate the app from English to Spanish (and back).
